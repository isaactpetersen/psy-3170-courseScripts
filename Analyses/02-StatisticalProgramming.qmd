# Intro

This is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) file.
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
This allows you to share your analyses and results with others so that they can see the results in line with the code for reproducibility.
Make sure to have only one sentence per line.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
